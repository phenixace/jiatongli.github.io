I am currently a Ph.D. student of the Department of Computing (COMP), The Hong Kong Polytechinic University (funded by **HKPFS**). Before joining the PolyU, I received my Master degree of Information Technology (with Distinction) from the University of Melbourne, under the supervision of Dr. Lea Frermann. In 2021, I got my bachelor degree of Information Security from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am a self-motivated person and have strong passion for scientific research. Currently, my research interest lies in Drug Discovery, Dialogue Systems, and Smart Infrastructure. I am always welcoming collaboration from solid partners.
