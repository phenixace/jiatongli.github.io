collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-10-25-paper-title-number-4
excerpt: 'This paper takes the functional layout of the emergency departments (EDs) of general hospitals as the research object, combines the hierarchical design concepts and proposes an intelligent functional layout generation method for EDs. It aims to explore the application of intelligent algorithms in architectural design and build an intelligent design method to solve the generation problem of ED layouts.'
